# ROCm requires accesses to the host's /dev/kfd and /dev/dri/* device nodes, typically
# owned by the `render` and `video` groups. The groups' GIDs in the container must
# match the host's to access the resources. Sometimes the device nodes may be owned by
# dynamic GIDs (that don't belong to the `render` or `video` groups). So instead of
# adding user to the GIDs of named groups (obtained from `getent group render` or
# `getent group video`), we simply check the owning GID of the device nodes on the host
# and pass it to `docker run` with `--group-add=<GID>`.
